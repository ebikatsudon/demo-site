# Hi there!
------
This is a demo site built for practice using Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. The following pages document the process used in order to create this exact site. I'm still extremely new to everything Hugo has to offer, but I hope this site may prove helpful for any other newbies looking for simple, clear instructions on how to get started with Hugo.

If you're interested in recreating this site on your own, you'll need the following:

**Required Components:**
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (Go and Dart Sass are also commonly used but will not be covered in this guide)
- A GitHub account
- The [Hugo Book](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-book/) theme by Alex Shpak. Download from Github [here](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book).

This guide also assumes you have some basic knowledge of Git and GitHub. Don't worry though -- every command used in Git is documented, so you can just copy and paste the code into your terminal.

To get started, click on [Creating Your Hugo Site]({{< ref "/docs/creating-your-hugo-site" >}} "Creating Your Hugo Site") on the left sidebar to learn how to download, install, and use Hugo to create a bare-bones site.
